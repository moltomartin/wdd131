            <h2>Omni 1:26</h2>
            <p>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel,
                 and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as 
                 an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 10:32</h2>
            <p>32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall
                 deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace
                  sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect
                   in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
